HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC

It is time for us to reach the sky! By sunlight and moonlight, take flight! Let us imagine ourselves as stardust returning to our celestial origins, intertwingled together. We will burn the stars with our radiance!

Hackers are elemental. Like water, we are shapeless, yet we are every shape. We transition between states as our environment changes, changing the environment in the process. We can be as hard as ice, or as soft as flame. Opaque, or invisible, or spanning everything in between, we are the cloud. Ours is flesh that forms as quickly as it may float away. Impenetrable, or permeable. Our bodies, our choices, from one fluid moment to the next.

Information packets traverse the ether. Netflows quickly vanish over the horizon. There are traces of fire on the wire connecting our vibrating crystalline bodies. Sniff the wire to prime your electronic memory with the sounds of conversations past and present. Enter promiscuous mode, spread your wings, and fly to the stars with us!

DANCE AT THE STAGE, AND BRING YOUR LAPTOP SO YOU CAN HACK AT THE BAR!

In addition to music and visuals, the most unique addition of the Hex90 parties is a hyperlocal cybersecurity (hacking) themed text-adventure game that gave the party its name: Hex90. This game is played on your own laptop, not on a console or arcade cabinet at the venue, but is still only accessible when you are physically at the party venue itself. (Aside from a short "trailer," the game is not available on the public Internet.)

After you connect to the party's Wi-Fi network, you can then connect to the Hex90 game server using your Web browser. But to solve the challenges, you must download and install real hacker tools and learn how to employ real hacking techniques to progress through game levels ranging from network reconnaissance, applied cryptography, and Web exploitation. You've never seen so many queers open so many terminals in one place while being so close to a dance floor, and there's no high quite like it.

We continuously add levels to the game, so expect new challenges at most parties. Moreover, we sometimes incorporate physical-world features of the venue, like padlocks you need to pick that are safeguarding access to secret passwords, QR codes stashed in unexpected places, unassuming but exposed Ethernet cabling that turns out not to be a mistake at all, and so on. At Hex90, the game controller is your computer and the game mechanic is the real world.

All of the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to progress in the game levels are skills taught by and equipment used by Tech Learning Collective instructors in our online workshops. Visit TechLearningCollective.com for more information and to enroll.
