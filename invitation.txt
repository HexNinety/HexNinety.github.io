NOTICE:
This space is not exclusionary, but it is an intentionally queer space. Consent and respect are not optional! Anyone being disrespectful will be removed immediately without a refund. We are against technocapitalist motives. We are a space for queer hackers, not for Silicon Valley fans. Don't piss off the hackers. ;)
