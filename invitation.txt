TO QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD

COLD BOOT (SECRET//NOFORN)

HEX90 â€” a queer hacker salon in nyc

The most powerful magic of all is the power of language.

Perhaps you are still becoming aware of yourself as a magician. Perhaps you can already code, but don't feel connected to the vibrating silicon enchanting your every keypress when you inscribe your intentions as spell-craft into your computer. Perhaps you don't yet know how to write the proper incantations, but already feel strangely drawn to the arcane sigils and symbols animating the metal and electric fires in your machine.

We are witches, wizards, and techno-sorceresses. The shape shifters, the body-changers, the tele-mindful whose technology is humanity and connection itself. We were the original programmers, the first hackers. And now, we are returning.
