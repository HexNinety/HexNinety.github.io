TO QUEER HACKERS OF THE WORLD

OVERFLOW (SECRET//NOFORN)

HEX90 — a queer hacker salon in NYC

Everything is circles.

The past becomes the present, the present becomes the future, and the future becomes the past again. The same water in the ocean rises to the sky before returning to the sea. Which memories fade and which are refreshed? What lies beyond the waterfall of time and space?

We are hackers, the witches, the wizards, the techno-sorceresses whose shapes shift within an infinite loop. We are the essence of the more.

Constraints do not restrain us. Limitations give us powers others cannot understand because they do not see beyond the overflow.

They store integers in finite fields. We use those integers as portals into their machines. They reduce gender to a binary. We stretch those roles to (re)create theaters of infinite expressive possibility. They "build" software. We write reality. They "engineer" services. We enchant souls. They "command" tools. We invoke demons.

Everything is circles.
